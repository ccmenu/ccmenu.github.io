            <p>Clicking on a pipeline in the menu opens the link given to CCMenu by the server. Problems like the wrong page opening, port missing, or incorrect URL scheme must be fixed on the server.</p>

                <p>Add workflows by owner (user or organisation) and repository. You can choose to monitor all branches or a specific one.</p>
                <p>Sign in at GitHub to access private repositories. CCMenu will start a flow so that you can authorise it as an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps">OAuth app</a> on GitHub.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the scopes for OAuth apps are broad, as discussed <a href="https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu2/discussions/8">here</a>. CCMenu only performs read operations. You can see its full use of the GitHub API in <a href="https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu2/blob/main/CCMenu/Source/Server%20Monitor/GitHubAPI.swift">this class</a>.</p>

                <p>Add projects from a CCTray feed. In most cases you only have to enter the hostname and port and CCMenu will discover the full feed URL. If this doesn't work you have to provide the full URL.</p>
                <p>You can enter credentials for HTTP Basic auth if the feed is protected in this way. Currently, no other authentication mechanisms are supported.</p>
